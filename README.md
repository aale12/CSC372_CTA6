## Option 1: Storing an ArrayList

### This application is consists of several classes

### Student Class
- The student class contains attributes of name, address, and roll number, along with associated getters, setters, constructors, and toString methods.
### Comparator Classes
- There are two comparator classes, one for name and one for roll number.  These classes both implement the Comparator interface from the java utility package.
### Selection Sort class
- The selection sort class contains code for a selection sort based on the two comparator classes and the student class
### Driver class
- The driver class creates 10 students and places them in an array list, the selectionsort class' sort method is then called and the names and roll numbers of the students are compared and sorted.
